# Calamity-Injector
A Lua Script injector for roblox made in C#

Meant for only injecting scripts

Has a built in GUI I have been working on

(Made with the We Are Devs API, this program is not special, its meant to be free for everyone who wants an injector.)

Also for anyone wondering there is obviously no virus, that would just be mean. VirusTotal (MainTool, Currently Flagged by a few.)- https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c6084452d460cbf24325687854ff903be2f327d54ce15de9edda505b61acab13/detection

And also for the people who got the program flagged, that would mostly likely be the We Are Devs API geting flagged because its a 'Hack Tool'. This is fine obviously, just set it as allowed. There is also the main tool itself being flagged but it is not harmful, if it is flagged, set it too allow it.
# Errors
If the tool has the error '404', this means that you have to delete the current api(dll) file and replace it with a new one you download from the original site at -

Typically you should not come across this error, if you do that means that we are devs is having an issue.

Using Calamity Injector in any malicious way can be illegal, although you'll just be banned on roblox.
